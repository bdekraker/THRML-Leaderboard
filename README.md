## 📊 Detailed Algorithm Descriptions & Test Results

### 1. SRSL - Stochastic Resonance Signal Lifter

**Purpose**: Amplifies weak signals buried in noise by finding optimal temperature (β = 1/T) that maximizes mutual information I(X;Y).

**How It Works**: Instead of broadband amplification, SRSL sweeps β values and selects the β* that maximizes information transfer per unit energy. This surfaces weak patterns (like spoof artifacts) without amplifying noise.

**SoundSafe Application**: Pre-processes audio streams for deepfake detection. Lifts faint spoof artifacts that would be missed by traditional methods.

**Extropic Advantage**: The chip's Gibbs dynamics at β* = 1/T* naturally maximize I(X;Y) per Joule. Weak patterns amplify via thermalization without additional FLOPs.

**Test Results**:
- **CPU**: 150.71 samples/sec, rho1=0.493, tau_int=2.94, ESS/sec=51.22
- **GPU**: 22.11 samples/sec, rho1=0.531, tau_int=3.26, ESS/sec=6.77
- **Energy Improvement**: 61.1% reduction vs baseline GPU (projected)
- **Intelligence Improvement**: 183.3% increase in detection accuracy (projected)

### 2. TAPS - Thermodynamic Active Perception & Scheduling

**Purpose**: Energy-aware sensor activation and bitrate scheduling based on threat scores. Minimizes Joules while maintaining coverage.

**SoundSafe Application**: Schedules audio/video sensors and bitrates for weapon/aggression/loitering detection. Only activates high-power sensors when threat scores justify the energy cost.

**Extropic Advantage**: Chip finds optimal sensor subsets via Gibbs sampling, minimizing energy while maintaining detection probability thresholds.

**Test Results**:
- **CPU**: 3,154.5 samples/sec, rho1=-0.276, tau_int=0.57, ESS/sec=5,561.4
- **GPU**: 454.0 samples/sec, rho1=-0.279, tau_int=0.56, ESS/sec=805.1

### 3. BPP - Boltzmann Policy Planner

**Purpose**: Temperature-controlled policy sampling for decision-making. Escalates responses under Rules of Engagement (ROE) constraints.

**How It Works**: Samples policies from a Boltzmann distribution at temperature T. Lower T = more conservative, higher T = more exploratory. ROE constraints encoded as energy penalties.

**SoundSafe Application**: Generates escalation policies for threat responses. Ensures ROE compliance while minimizing risky decisions.

**Extropic Advantage**: Chip's Gibbs sampling naturally samples from Boltzmann distributions, minimizing risky policy selections.

**Test Results**:

**SoundSafe Application**: Detects anomalous sounds (distress, breaking glass, unusual movement). Per-site baselines adapt to normal site activity.

**Extropic Advantage**: Chip maintains energy fingerprints in hardware. Anomaly checks are simple energy comparisons (ultra-low cost).

**Test Results**: (Note: EFSM benchmark not included in CPU/GPU results - see source repository for full benchmarks)

### 5. TBRO - Thermal Bandit Resource Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Resource allocation using thermal bandit sampling. Routes compute to high-risk zones while minimizing energy.

**How It Works**: Models resource allocation as a multi-armed bandit with energy costs. Thermal sampling explores/exploits trade-off naturally.

### 6. LABI - Landauer-Aware Bayesian Inference

**Purpose**: Energy-optimal inference by gating updates based on entropy reduction. Only pays kT ln 2 per bit when entropy actually decreases.

**How It Works**: Computes likelihood deltas ΔH. If ΔH < threshold, skip expensive inference update (Landauer's principle: kT ln 2 per bit erased).

**SoundSafe Application**: Gates expensive inference updates in anomaly detection. Only updates when entropy reduction justifies the energy cost.

**Extropic Advantage**: Chip naturally enforces Landauer's limit. Updates only occur when entropy reduction exceeds kT ln 2 threshold.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Framework

All algorithms are built on **THRML** (developed by Extropic AI), a JAX library for:
- Blocked Gibbs sampling for probabilistic graphical models
- Arbitrary PyTree node states
- Support for heterogeneous graphical models
- Discrete EBM utilities

### Extropic Hardware Integration

Extropic's thermodynamic compute silicon chips:
- **Thermalize towards low energy states** via Gibbs dynamics
- **Massively parallel Gibbs sampler**: The entire chip operates as a parallel sampler
- **Energy relaxation**: Continuously relaxes toward equilibrium distributions
- **Ultra-low power**: Designed for orders of magnitude better energy efficiency than GPUs

Each algorithm sets up an Energy-Based Model (EBM) or Hamiltonian so the chip's native dynamics compute the desired inference/action at minimal energy.

### Why Thermodynamic Compute Reduces Joules While Increasing Tokens

- **SRSL**: Finds β that maximizes information per unit energy (not raw gain)
- **LABI**: Enforces kT ln 2 per bit only when entropy reduces enough (skips expensive updates)
- **TAPS/TBRO**: Set up Hamiltonians with explicit energy costs (chip finds low-energy sensing/compute subsets)
- **REF**: Stabilizes feature extraction (fewer FLOPs, smoother downstream sampling)
- **TCF**: Learns robust fusion with small do-perturbations (fewer false positives, fewer re-computes)
